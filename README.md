Used CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) to create a Cricket Score Viewer like in a Cricket Match. It can be Continuously updated whenever the batsman gets his runs or if there are any extras and also keeps the number of balls in account

[ Used Jenkins for CI/CD, AWS as the cloud platform and Tomcat to host the website ]
